# A Curious Course on Coroutines and Concurrency 
This repository contains adapted for Python 3 code samples for [tutorial on generator-based coroutines by David Beazley](http://www.dabeaz.com/coroutines/). Original code samples can be found [here](http://www.dabeaz.com/coroutines/coroutines.zip).

Python files were converted with [2to3 tool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/2to3.html) and reformatted with [black](https://github.com/psf/black), C extension code was [migrated by hand](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/cporting.html) and reformatted with [AStyle](http://astyle.sourceforge.net/). Any other files from the original zip archive are left unmodified.
